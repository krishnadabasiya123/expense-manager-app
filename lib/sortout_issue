in each page -> check dart lidht theme and color

buid not design any parameter use in initstate (in transaction_list screen check) rest all done
in transaction_screen -> check build method (not call api there also mindate maxdate check)

flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs


question

add category -> delete transaction -> now when delete category -> in soft delete catgory set to null or set to '
amount -> validation (like 2 point not allow)

account amount -> where used



in date selection after again tap date not come proper check that
category -> budget use chip
date check in budget endate and in transaction date is big then end date then transaction not add in budget
date chnage -> 3 to 10 date budget
transaction 3 date 
now amount cut
again if date chnage to 10 date update that transaction then what about amount


in add transaction screen when tab chanhe lable name not chnage 
in expense name , income name , transfer name


in all type check budget spent


update category -> category nam in transactiona nd in budget change , account same update name
